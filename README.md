This is a program for doing data structure tasks.
This program does 5 tasks:
1.Binary search:Task 1 does binary search for you.You give it a array,then input the element that you want to be found and lastly,it finds your requested element.
2.Sort array:There are 2 sort methods for you and you can choose the method that you want.The methods are insertion and selection sort.Note that the sorts will be done step by step and you can see the steps.
3.Converting infix expression into prefix or postfix:You can convert an infix expression into a postfix or prefix.You choose prefix or postfix.
4.Heapify:You give the program an array,and choose max heap or min heap.Then,the program performs the selected algorithm and gives you the desired result.
5.BFS:You give the adjactency matrix of a graph to the program and the program performs bfs algorithm on the graph and generates the best result for you.
If you have recommendation for fixing the bugs,increasing randeman,or optimizing the code,I'll be happy to hear your ideas.
